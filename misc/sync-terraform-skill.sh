# Syncs the terraform-skill from the upstream repo by Anton Babenko.
# Source: https://github.com/antonbabenko/terraform-skill
# License: Apache License 2.0
#
# This script treats the upstream repo as the source of truth.
# It clones the upstream repo into a temp directory, then replaces
# our local terraform-skill folder with ONLY the core skill components:
#   - SKILL.md       (the skill itself)
#   - LICENSE         (required for Apache 2.0 compliance)
#   - references/*.md (progressive disclosure content referenced by SKILL.md)
#
# Everything else (README, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md,
# tests/, .github/, .claude-plugin/) is left behind — those are repo
# management files, not skill components.
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x misc/sync-terraform-skill.sh
#   ./misc/sync-terraform-skill.sh
#
# Run from the repo root (sample-apex-skills/).
